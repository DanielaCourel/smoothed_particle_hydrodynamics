## Why SPH?
We have a bunch of particles we'd like to animate just like real water
would move like. The more physically correct the simulation is the more
convincing the effect looks like. Navier and Stokes developed equations
that serve this very purpose. SPH gives approximations for every term
in the Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. SPH helps us doing the actual math.


## Terms
Examples for fluids: Gasses (e.g. air), Liquids (e.g. water), aerosols  
Examples for liquids: Water, everything that's (mostly) incompressible  
Examples for aerosols:  Smoke  


## Incompressible Navier-Stokes
Mr. Navier and Mr. Stokes developed equations for the motion of fluids.
The 'Incompressible Navier-Stokes' variant can be used to compute the
motion of fluids that are not compressible - like liquids, or water in
particular.

The Incompressible Navier-Stokes equation consist of two elements:
- The equation of motion
- The equation of mass continuity

### The 'equation of motion'
The equation of motion says that changes in velocity are described as
a function of

- gravity g
- (a gradient of) pressure ∇p:  
   fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure regions
- velocity u∇²v
- viscosity u:
   the fluid stickiness, low: air water, high: honey, mud

I.e. the fluid moves
- under the force of gravity
- under the force of pressure
- under the force of the 'viscous term'

### The 'mass continuity equation'

```      
   ρ       ( ∇ dot v ) = 0
   ^         ^
   density   divergence of velocity
```
The equation of mass continuity expresses that mass is neither created
nor destroyed.

For the incompressible equation the density is assumed to be constant.
Therefore for our purpose it does not need to be considered. All the
mass we will start with, we will still have at the end.

Since the mass continuity equations just says that we must not create
nor destroy particles while we're computing (i.e. we are assuming a
constant number of particles), this term does not need to be solved.

So back to the equation of motion.

It looks like this:
```      
   ρ * [dv/dt + v dot ∇v] = ρ * g - ∇p + u∇²v
```
ρ: density of the fluid, a scalar variable  
p: pressure of the fluid, also a scalar variable  
g: gravity, a 3D vector  
v: velocity, also a 3D vector  

In words:
```
              the           the convective
   density * [derivative  + acceleration  ] = gravity - pressure + viscosity
              of velocity   term                        gradient   term
```

The 'convective acceleration term':
```
   v dot ∇v = [v  * dv / dx; v  * dv / dy; v * dv  / dz]
                x     x       y     y       z     z
                      ^             ^            ^
                      partial derivatives of v with respect
                      to x, y and z
```
If fluids have to move through an area of limited space, their
velocity increases. That's because the same volume of fluid is moved
from a larger region to an area with less space. A good example is
water flowing through a hose.

The 'pressure gradient':
```
   - ∇p = [dp / dx; dp / dy; dp / dz]

           ^
           partial derivatives of p with respect
           to x, y and z
```
A gradient can be understood as a slope in a higher dimension (like
a hillside). The sign of the pressure gradient function is negative.
This is because the system moves from a region of high pressure to a
region of low pressure.

The pressure p is defined as follows:
```
   p = k       (ρ              - ρ0)
       ^        ^                ^
       some     actual           resting density
       scalar   density of       (the density of the fluid
                the fluid at      at equilibrium)
                a given point
```
ρ > ρ0 => positive pressure
ρ < ρ0 => negative pressure (suction)

The 'viscosity term':
```
   u * ∇² * v = [ ∇²v , ∇²v , ∇²v  ]
                     x     y     z
```
∇² is also called the 'Laplacian operator' or the 'diffusion operator'. It diffuses whatever quantity it is applied to.  
=> It is diffusing velocity.  
=> It is diffusing the momentum of the system.  
Diffusing the velocity of the system will result in a system having identical velocities at every position sooner or later.


### The material derivative

We want to represent the dynamics of the system by a set of
particles and we do that by taking the material derivative. The
material derivative is the derivative along a path with a given
velocity v.
```
   ρ * Dv/Dt = ρ * g - ∇ p + u ∇² v
```

Now we have a simple equation for the motion of a single particle i:
```
   dvᵢ        1       u    
   ――― = g -  ―― ∇p + ―― ∇² v
   dt         ρᵢ      ρᵢ
```
The derivative of the velocity of particle i with respect to time is gravity - (the pressure gradient / the density ρ) plus (the viscosity term devided by our density ρ).

These are the equations we will actually solve.

### From Navier Stokes to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
We can represent any quantity by the summation of nearby points multiplied with a weighting function W. W is also called 'smoothing kernel'. They've been introduced by Monaghan in '92 - *sigh*.

W will give more strength to points that are close to us
- Points that are further away from us have a weaker influence on us.
- For points away more than a certain distance, W will return 0, i.e. they don't affect us at all. How far a quantity must be away before it stops interacting with us is called the 'interaction radius'

This is evaluating a quantity by sampling a neighborhood of space and weighting points by how close they are to our sampling points.

Monaghan also introduced approximations to the terms of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.

## Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
Here are the approximations for the individual terms of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:

```
   ρᵢ ≃ Σ mⱼ W (r - rⱼ, h )
```

I.e. the density is approximately equal to the sum of the masses of nearby points, weighted by the smoothing kernel W. Density is the amount of mass at a given point, so this should be fairly reasonable. So we approximate the density at point i by the summation of neighboring points j (weighted appropriately).

```
   ∇pᵢ           pᵢ   pⱼ
   ―――  ≃ Σ mⱼ( ――― + ――― ) ∇W (r - rⱼ , h)
   ρᵢ            ρ²ᵢ  ρ²ⱼ            
```
The pressure gradient divided by ρ i is approximately equal to the sums of the masses at various points j multiplied by a scalar quantity of pressure over density. The term is multiplied by the gradient of a smoothing kernel (∇W) which is a vector expression (since a gradient is a vector). Therefore the result of this whole expression is a vector value.

3)
```
   u           u          vⱼ - vᵢ       
   ―― ∇² vᵢ ≃ ――― Σ mⱼ ( ――――――― ) ∇² W (r - rⱼ, h)
   ρᵢ          ρᵢ         ρⱼ                    
```

u is a scalar coefficient that says how viscous is the fluid. If you choose a small value for u it behaves like water, for larger values of u its behavior is more like sirup.

This viscosity term is approximately u divided by ρ multiplied with the sum of the masses of several points j nearby multiplied by the difference in velocity between two points (i and j), divided by the density of j. Finally the term is multiplied by the Laplacian of the smoothing kernel ∇²W. If vj and vi are equal, there's no viscous interaction between them, if the difference between them is small, there's a small viscous interaction and for large differences
between vi and vj, there will be a large viscous interaction.

Over time this term has the effect of encouraging particles to travel together (to move in the same direction).

## Smoothing kernels

Attributes of smoothing kernels:
- At a distance h, w will drop to 0. I.e. particles that are too far away will not interact with the particle currently processed.
- Over a sphere of radius h, w sums to 1.

```
   |r - r  |²: the distance between two points, squared
         b
```
There's not much intuition about these :)

1) 
```
             315
   W =  ―――――――――――― ( h² - | r - r |² )³
        64 * π * h⁹                b
```

2) 

```         
                                         r - r
         -45                                  b
   ∇W =  ――――――― * ( h - | r - r  | )² * ――――――――――
         π * h⁶                 b        | r - r  |
                                                b
```
3)

```
                       45
   ∇² W (r - r , h ) = ―――――― * ( h - | r - r  | )
              b        π * h⁶                b
```

### Algorithm
```
   dvᵢ       1       u      
   ――― = g - ―― ∇p + ―― ∇² v  
   dt        ρᵢ      ρᵢ  
```
Based on the material derivative, we do the following:

1) Compute an approximation for ρ for every particle using equation 1.

2) Evaluate equation 2, the pressure gradient. It depends on ρ, so ρ needs to be computed first. It also depends on the pressure gradient which is calculated by computing the difference between ρ and ρ0, the resting potential (see above).

3) Evaluate equation 3, the viscous term. It depends on ρ and on the current velocity of the particle.

4) After having computed all the approximations, we can put them together in the material derivative formula. Using a simple numerical scheme we can timestep the velocity first and then compute the new position of the particle.

### In short
For each particle
1) compute the density
2) compute the pressure from density
3) compute the pressure gradient
4) calc the viscosity term
5) timestep the velocity and calculate the next position

## Optimizations
Without optimization we'd have to test every particle against every particle (O(n²)). The result will still be correct because the smoothing kernel W will give 0 for as result for all particles that are outside the interaction radius.

1) Voxels
   Device space into local regions of space (voxels). Those voxels should have the size 2h on a side (twice the interactivity radius; quantities outside this radius are not interacting with the particle).

   So a particle can only interact with
   - particles in the same voxel and in
   - adjacent voxels

   If a particle was exactly in the center of a voxel, it could only interact with particles in the same voxel; if it's not in the perfect center, it could interact with particles of 2x2x2 voxels.

2) Subsets
   Choose a random subset of n particles (for example 32) because in most cases it's not required to take all the particles into account. Those 32 are good enough.
